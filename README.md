# OutNet
This is an Advanced Chat plugin for Minecraft Servers developed using: #Python, #Java, #CSharp, #Php and #JavaScript (5 of my favourite coding languages).

# How To Install
The first step is making a Java plugin with the files that are on the OutNet/Java's folder(Main.java and msg.java)
But you have the full code in the folder "Download".
After that, we have to "Export" the code to the plugin folder of your minecraft server as 'OutNet.jar'
