# OutNet
This is an Advanced Chat plugin for Minecraft Servers developed using: #Python, #Java, #CSharp, #Php and #JavaScript (5 of my favourite coding languages).

# How To Install
**The First Step** is making a Java plugin with the files that are on the OutNet/Java's folder(Main.java and msg.java)<br>
But you have the full code in the folder "Download".<br>
After that, we have to "Export" the code to the plugin folder of your minecraft server as 'OutNet.jar'<br>

<br>
**The Second Step** is going to the website's folder (var/www/html or C:/xampp/htdocs) and creating a folder named "OutNet" (C:/xampp/htdocs/OutNet/ on windows and /var/www/html/OutNet on linux)<br>
And after that, we have to paste the next files:<br>

- 'Ping folder' on OutNet/Python<br>
- 'chat.php' on OutNet/PHP<br>
- 'index.php' on OutNet/PHP<br>
- 'listener.php on OutNet/PHP<br>
- 'logs.txt' on OutNet/Others<br>
- 'photo.png' on OutNet/Others<br>
- 'players.py' on OutNet/Python<br>
- 'sound.mp3' on OutNet/Others<br>
- 'styles.css' on OutNet/Others<br>

**The Third Step** is checking that the connection between Java plugin and Website works perfdectly, so, let's check!<br>

**The Fourth Step** is creating the C#'s GUI<br>
Let's open a Windows Application Forms (.NET FRAMEWORK) on Visual Basic and creating the next files:<br>
